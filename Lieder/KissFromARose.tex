\[E] There used to be a greying \[C]tower a\[D]lone on the \[E]sea.
You became the \[C]light on the \[D]dark side of \[E]me,
but love remains a \[D]drug that's the \[A]high not the \[E]pill,
but did you know that when it \[Em]snows,
my \[C]eyes become \[D]large and the \[C]light that you \[D]shine can be \[E]seen?
\endverse

\beginchorus
Ba\[E]by, I compare you to a \[C]kiss from a \[D]rose on the \[E]grey,
ooh, the more I get of you the \[C]stranger it \[D]feels, ye\[E]ah.
And now that your \[C]rose is in \[D]bloom,
a \[C]light hits the \[D]gloom on the \[E]grey.

\[E] There is so much a man can \[C]tell you so \[D]much he can \[E]say.
You remain my \[C]power, my \[D]pleasure, my \[E]pain, baby,
to \[C]me you're like a growing ad\[D]diction that I can't de\[E]ny.
Won't you tell me is that \[C]healthy baby, \[D]
but did you \[E]know that when it \[Em]snows,
my \[C]eyes become \[D]large and the \[C]light that you \[D]shine can be \[E]seen?
