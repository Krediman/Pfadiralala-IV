\beginverse\memorize
\[Gm]City of stars,\[C] are you shining just for\[Dm] me?
\[Gm]City of stars,\[C] there's so much that I can't\[F] see.
Who \[Gm]knows?\[C] I felt it from the first em\[F]brace I\[F/E] shared with \[Dm7]you.
That \[Gm]now our \[A]dreams, they've finally come \[Dm]true. \[Dm7]
\endverse

\beginverse
^City of stars,^ just one thing everybody^ wants.
^There in the bars^ and through the smokescreen of the ^crowded restaurants.
It's ^love,^ yes, all we're looking for is ^love from ^someone ^else.
A ^rush, a glance, a ^touch, a dance.
A \[B&]look in somebody's \[C]eyes to light up the \[A]skies,
to open the \[Dm]world and send them \[Dm7]reeling.
A \[B&]voice that says, I'll be \[C]here, and you'll be al\[Dm]right.
\[B&]I don't care if I \[C]know, just where I will \[A]go,
'Cause all that I \[Dm]need's this crazy \[Dm7]feeling, 
a \[B&]rat-tat-tat on my \[A]heart...
Think I want it to \[Dm]stay. \[Dm7]
\endverse

\beginverse
^City of stars,^ are you shining just for ^me?
^City of stars,\[A] you never shined so bright\[Dm]ly.
